# *Week 5* VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program ![OpenROAD Floorplan & Placement](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenROAD_Floorplan_%26_Placement-Done-darkgreen)

`19/10/2025` to `25/10/2025`

In this experiment, we use **OpenROAD Flow Scripts** to perform the **Floorplan** and **Placement** stages of the physical design flow for the **GCD** circuit. This marks the transition from **SPICE-level transistor design (Week 4)** to the backend implementation phase, where the synthesized GCD logic is transformed into an actual **physical layout** using automated EDA tools.
